# Statistical-Machine-Learning

This repository has been created for this specific course. 
It contains the code for the class project. 
My project is on fairness learning.
The dataset is the Adult dataset which predicts one if the income is greater than 50k dollars and zero otherwise.

Different model types:
1: unconstrained
2. sensitive feature removed
3. regularization term
4. regularization term + constraint
